		Project 2

Project was done in visula studio.
In order to run it, we use the commands:
	1. antlr4 PascalGrammar.g4 -visitor //create file
	2. javac *.java
	3. java PascalGrammar tests/test1.pas
Our project works fine; but there is an issue in function visitor. where when it parses, and there is a written statement it will print 2 times. This does not affect the actual output and it is correct computationally. There is just an error visually. Other than that everything should work correctly including scopes in functions, for loops, while loops, and breaks and continue.
